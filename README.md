# SB-Project-Version2.0
## This is the second update/version of the SB Project Version 1.0.

# I decided to create a seperate repository for the updated project version due to simplicity with:
### - adding more features, 
### - appearance qualities, 
### - more complex program implementations, 
### - and generally will be almost as if I am creating a brand new project
